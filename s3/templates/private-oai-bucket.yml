             This will *not* use S3's built-in

# Create a private S3 bucket that will be exposed as a website through a CDN distribution using OAI. Only the bucket
# owner and the CloudFront distribution that is attached to the OAI will have access to the bucket. This will *not*
# use S3's built-in functionality for exposing an S3 bucket as a website. When using that functionality with a custom
# domain name, the bucket name must match the domain name. However, in this case, since it is not S3 that is exposing
# the bucket, that limitation does not apply, so any valid bucket name will do.
